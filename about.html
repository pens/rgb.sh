        Hi, I'm Seth Pendergrass.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a computer programmer that likes triangles and pretty colors.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like brutalist web design. I did this on purpose, if you would believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up in the Portland area and went to the University of Washington to get a computer degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.
        I like making latte art and playing saxophone.
