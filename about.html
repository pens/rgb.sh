<div class="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm Seth Pendergrass.</p>
    <p>I'm a computer programmer that likes drawing triangles in pretty colors.</p>
    <p>I like brutalist web design. I did this on purpose, if you would believe it.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the Portland area, and then went to the University of Washington to get my degree in Computer Engineering.</p>
    <p>Currently, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my spare time I like practicing latte art and playing saxophone.</p>
