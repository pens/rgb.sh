        Hi, I'm Seth Pendergrass.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a computer programmer that likes drawing triangles in pretty colors.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like brutalist web design. I did this on purpose, if you would believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up in the Portland area, and then went to the University of Washington to get my degree in Computer Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my spare time, I like making latte art and playing saxophone.
