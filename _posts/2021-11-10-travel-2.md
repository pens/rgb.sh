I'm going to keep this as short as possible so as to not read like a web recipe.

*My least favorite aircraft to fly on, the [Q400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_Dash_8). At least there is a great [copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/a9p4ie/bombardier_dash_8_q400/).*

## Packing List

This list is highly variable based on your destinations and preferences.

I aim for a pretty minimal, layered approach that lets you adapt to any conditions.
I only take what I can fit into my carry-on sized bag (although I do use the daypack as well during flights, to hold my electronics and help reduce the main bag's weight on check-in).

- Documents & Money
  - Debit card
  - Credit card
  - Passport
  - Insurance
  - Passport, Insurance copies
    - Originals in main bag, copies in daypack
- Bags
  - <= 40L travel bag
    - Fits in overhead bins, allowing you to never check bags
  - Packable daypack
  - Optional: Packing cubes, dirty laundry bag, etc.

## Packing

*Pack overly light rather than overly heavy.*
The only things you absolutely need are your documents and money.
It's easy to pick up the things you actually need on the road.

### Documents & Money

- Get credit and debit cards with no foreign transaction fees.
- Some countries will need you to withdraw cash.
- Exchanging remaining currency before leaving a country is a good idea so you're not stuck with it.

### Bags

- Go for a one-bag setup, with a packable daypack.
Your main bag must be less than 40L to fit in airplane overhead bins, and you'll use the daypack as your personal item.
- Make sure daypack has some support.
My first one didn't and hurt my back when overloaded.
- I love packing cubes.

### Clothing

- You can wear items multiple times without a wash, and laundry is generally cheap at hostels.
Sinks are also an option.
- Wool items go even longer without smelling.
Getting a synthetic and wool blend gives smell resistance and durability.
- Wear all-purpose, understated sneakers.
Alongside a button-up, this'll let you dress up for dinner or clubs.
I regret wearing minimalist trail runners my first trip as it resulted in bad back pain that lasted for months after.

### Toiletries

- Dr. Bronner's is amazing for its compactness and many uses.
A travel bottle will last ages and frees up a lot of room.
I wouldn't say I like it as soap or toothpaste, but its compactness outweighs its unpleasantness for me.
- Be wary of bleaching sunscreens.

### Electronics

- I would recommend against a dedicated camera if you have to ask about it.
  - Phone cameras are always with you, and seriously simplify your life while traveling (e.g. less space and risk of theft).
  - I've settled on a mirrorless full frame with a compact 50mm lens.
    - This setup is super compact and takes great portraits and low-light shots.
    - I felt like a majority of my favorite photos from traveling last time were taken at this focal distance, so not having multiple lenses cuts down on weight and space.
- Don't buy a new, cheap laptop to travel like I did.
I bought a Surface Go with accessories, and it ended up being unpleasant and unnecessary.
  - Instead, I'd reconsider whether you need to bring a laptop at all; they are heavy and bulky, and ideally you don't want to be at your computer do you?
  - If you're like me and can't get away from technology, just bring your normal laptop.
  - In the future, I'd probably switch to an iPad Pro and SSH into my home computer to do real work.
- I love Google Fi while traveling.
It's much more expensive than getting a SIM card in each country, but the convenience of having high-speed data as soon as you touch down is well worth it.
- You should pretty much be able to find high-speed internet anywhere you go.

### Other

- Don't bring a UV water filter like I did.
Just buy water instead.
It was an absolute waste of space I never used in two months.

## Stays

- Stay at hostels.
They're all different, but usually a ton of fun.
You'll get to meet a huge diversity of people, and save a lot of money over a hotel.
  - Hostelworld is great for seeing reviews and booking things ahead of time.
  - It's also fun to just walk in the door and ask for a room.
- I like to give myself plenty of time in each place.
This let's me see some of the main attractions, while still having time to wander wherever looks or sounds cool.
I've ended up seeing a lot of awesome stuff I wouldn't have otherwise this way.
  - I'd also recommend taking days off, where you don't do anything "valuable".
  It's a great way to recharge, and will make things more fun long term.

## Miscellaneous

- Don't eat out for every meal.
Grocery stores are their own experience in each place.
Hostels usually have cooking facilities you can use, including cookware and dishes.
  - Bread and hummus is a great, cheap option for food.
