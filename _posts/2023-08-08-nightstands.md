Rather than donating my family's old futon, we opted to reuse the wood for other projects.
I decided to try building myself some nightstands.

## Phase 1: Design and Tops/Bottoms

This project started out over the 2021 Christmas holiday.
I had a lot of fun just hanging out in my dad's shop, slowly making progress on the design and construction of these nightstands.

*The ends of the old futon, post scavenging slats.*

I ripped out all of the smaller pieces of wood from the futon I could.
It ended up where I had a fair bit of thinner, wider planks and quite a lot of thicker but narrower slats.
As such, I ended up coming up with a design that would use the slats nearly as-is.

![Step 2](/assets/blog/nightstands/2.jpg)
*Gluing together larger panels to make the tops and bottoms.*

The planks were cut to matching lengths and glued into larger panels to form the top and bottom of each nightstand.

*Planing the tops and bottoms flat.*

I wish I had had access to a belt sander or tabletop planer at this point to really even out the tops, as it required a lot of manual effort.

*Mockup of the design of the sides.*

I played around with a couple of designs until I found an idea for what I thought would look good and make use of the slats without series re-working.

*Glue-up of the tops/bottoms.*

The tops / bottoms were glued into rabbets made on some of the slats edges to make them flush.
I did this with a hand router followed up by sandpaper.

The corners were just cut to 45 degrees on a miter saw, and of course they were *ever-so-slightly* off.

*The tops/bottoms came together nicely.*

A little work with the planer and random orbit sander got the tops looking pretty nice and ready for assembly.

*Attaching the columns to one end.
The other end was just pressure fit during glue-up to help with alignment.*

I experimented with using brads to align the columns while gluing them onto the ends, but they actually ended up misaligning the columns.
I opted not to use brads on the other end of each nightstand.

## Phase 2: Assembly

The second phase didn't wrap up until almost a year and a half later, as I struggled to find time to work with wood on top of everything else I had going on.
As I was taking time off from working, I was finally able to get back to these.

![Step 8](/assets/blog/nightstands/8.jpg)
*Lots of sanding required.*

I had to finish cutting 45 degree ends into each slat, and sanding them down to get them ready to take a finish.
I started the process with a Japanese pull saw, and nearly went insane.
Waiting until much later when I had access to the radial arm saw was orders of magnitude better.

![Step 9](/assets/blog/nightstands/9.jpg)
*This design ended up much higher effort than desired.*

I spaced each slat by clamping it to the columns while sitting on my speed square.
This ended up being way more consistent than I expected.

Gluing all of the slats took about a week because I did not have enough clamps.

I should have been much more careful about the amount of glue I was using because I ended up wasting hours cleaning up the dried on glue out of the small inside space of the nightstands and the smaller grooves between slats.

![Step 10](/assets/blog/nightstands/10.jpg)
*Final gluing of body.*

Getting the ends glued on was actually a challenge because the columns were too far apart to fit within the slats already attached to the end.
I slightly split one of the end pieces trying to force it on, so I had to back up and sand down the columns to fit.

In trying to even out the tops and bottoms, I accidentally chipped off some edges/corners.
I used woodfill to repair it as best possible, which evened out well but is very obvious in the final surface.

After this point, I spent a ton of time sanding each nightstand body with each grit from 80, 120, 180, 220 through 400.
The end result was an insanely smooth surface.

![Step 11](/assets/blog/nightstands/11.jpg)
*I bought threaded metal plates and premade legs to ease the process.*

I chose to use premade legs during the initial design, and I had been holding onto the parts since then.
By this point, I was very happy with my decision as these were incredibly quick and easy to attach and looked great.

![Step 12](/assets/blog/nightstands/12.jpg)
*All legs attached.*

I couldn't quite get the legs to all be at the exact same angles, but it looks good enough.

![Step 13](/assets/blog/nightstands/13.jpg)
*Applying Danish oil.*

I decided to try something different and use Danish oil for these.
I like the natural wood tone, and it was super easy to use.

![Step 14](/assets/blog/nightstands/14.jpg)
*The final product, in place.*

I'm pretty happy with these.
They're unique, look pretty nice and seem sturdy.
And it's cool to have something new built out of my old furniture.
