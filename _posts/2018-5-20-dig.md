title: Digitization
---
Starting December of 2017, I began converting and organizing all of my family's old photos, videos and other content.
Not only would this make viewing our family memories easier, but it will reduce the chance that anything is lost to degredation or damage (e.g. fire or flooding).
Hopefully this post will be useful for others who wish to do the same.

_I've cleaned up the scripts below for privacy and readability, but I can't guarantee they will run as intended._

# Setup
![setup]({{ "/assets/dig/setup.jpg" }})
Before starting, I collected all of the content that would be a part of this process, as well as all of the equipment needed to use the media.
This included:
- VHS-C adapter for VHS
- VHS Player
- Digital8 camcorder
- USB CD/DVD player
- USB Capture Card
- Disc repair tool
- Head cleaners
- Scanner
- SD reader
- Compact Cassette player
- External Hard Drive

# Collection
![media]({{ "/assets/dig/media.jpg" }})
The first stage in this process was gathering all already digital content and converting all analog content to digital formats.

## Cassettes
Converting cassettes to digital video was surprisingly easy using the composite-to-USB adapter.
We still have VHS and Compact Cassette players, which meant that we only needed to find ways to play Video8 and VHS-C.

### Audio (Compact) Cassettes
Audio cassettes were captured using our cassette deck through the capture card's RCA audio inputs.
Unfortunately this meant that every recording was saved as a video file, but `ffmpeg` can easily correct this by striping out the video and converting to mono.

### Video Cassettes
I opted for a VHS-C to VHS converter, rather than a camcorder, as it was for a single tape.
For Video8, I went through two different camcorders from eBay.
The first was a basic Video8 camcorder, which began having tracking issues after digitizing only a couple tapes.
I bought a Digital8 camcorder with Video8 playback the second time around because it supports Time Based Correction and Digital Noise Reduction, as well as being quite a bit newer.
In theory these two technologies would improve the output of the tapes in a way I may not be able to do afterwards.
All of the playback devices were connected to a USB capture card by S-Video or composite.

## Discs
In order to speed up the process of copying discs, I hacked together a small script which copies everything on the external disc drive and then ejects the disc.
__This assumes it is being run on macOS.__

```bash
{% include dig/copy_disc.sh %}
```

### Bad CDs
![discs]({{ "/assets/dig/discs.jpg" }})
I came across two discs which my Mac reported as invalid.
My first thought was that they were either damaged or not burned correctly.
I used a disc repair tool on them both, but this had no effect.
Next, I attempted to use `dd`, `ddrescue`, `sleuthkit` and `foremost`.
However, none of these programs were able to help.
Using the external DVD reader on a Windows laptop I got a few files off, but there 5 `.zip` files that were still unreadable.
I assume they were not burned correctly, but based off of the other information on the discs I assume that the data is available from my other sources.
Readable data indicated that they were Windows Live OneCare backups of one of our old PC's.

```bash
{% include dig/repair_disc.sh %}
```

## Digital
### Computers
This was relatively easy; I only had to copy our desktop and user folders to my laptop.
Afterwards I manually dug through and organized the files.

### Memory Cards
SD cards were no problem, as they're still the standard for consumer cameras today.
However, I did come across 2 SmartMedia cards from an old digital camera, which even the local camera shop could not read.
I may purchase an old reader at some point, but I'm not sure there is anything on them which isn't already either available digitally or in our printed photos.

### Cloud
Digging through old files from the discs, I found references to old online accounts.
This allowed me to download old emails and files from high school and earlier.
From here, I could regain access to a number of long-forgotten online accounts before deleting them for privacy reasons.

## Paper
### Documents
For personal documents and old schoolwork, I just used a home scanner.
The resolution was more than adequate for the content, and fast enough for the limited number of items (as opposed to our family photos).

### Artwork
Artwork that I could fit in the scanner bed was scanned with the highest resolution possible.
Oversized pieces were layed flat on a table under even lighting and photographed with a DSLR on a tripod.

### Photos
Digitizing our family photos is by far the biggest part of this project.
My mom was an amateur film photographer for a long time; this resulted in a massive pile of prints, negatives and slides.
In addition, we have binders of photos and memorabilia from my grandparents to digitize as well.
Assuming all negatives and slides were also on print, we decided scanning the prints would suffice.
Unfortunately, this would probably take years to finish one photo at a time with our printer/scanner combo, so I opted to buy a specialized photo scanner.

# Processing
The second phase of this project was to organize the mountain of now digital content.
This included converting varying formats to a limited set playable on any device, organizing and deduplicating digital photos and sorting through all of the files collected from our computers.

## Audio
As the capture card doesn't record just audio, I used `ffmpeg` to strip out the video channel.
`ffprobe` reported the output as using the standard `.mp4` audio format `.aac`, so I used `ffmpeg` to just copy it out.
This is both quick and avoids degradation from converting between lossy codecs.

```bash
{% include dig/extract_audio.sh %}
```

For any Video8 cassettes, I had to convert the audio to mono.
The capture device did not take mono recordings, while all of our tapes were made and played back in mono.

```bash
{% include dig/stereo2mono.sh %}
```

Afterwards I trimmed the recordings manually in QuickTime Player `(Edit > Trim ...)` or Audacity with the ffmpeg plugin.

## Video
A number of our home videos were in formats that some platforms can't easily play, so I converted them to `.mp4`.
These included wmv; MOD, from our Everio camcorder; and VOB, from DVDs.

```bash
{% include dig/video2mp4.sh %}
```

These were also trimmed afterwards in QuickTime Player.

In cases where the videos were originally meant to a continuous whole (e.g. some DVD rips), I merged them with the following script:

```bash
{% include dig/merge_videos.sh %}
```

## Documents
ImageMagick's `convert` utility proved super easy to merge `.jpeg` scans of individual document pages into single `.pdf`'s.

```bash
{% include dig/merge_pages.sh %}
```

## Emails
After digging through the files copied off of the CDs, I was able to recover a number of old email addresses.
Unfortunately only my old Gmail account had not been wiped, but I was able to download all of my Drive and emails with [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/).
I wasn't that interested in the emails themselves, but there were a number of photos in their attachments that I wanted to extract.

For my first attempt, I used `ripmime` on the .mbox to separate out the emails.
However, most of the attachments were left encoded in base64 with headers.
I wrote a script to trim and decode these files, but there were still a few files that didn't process correctly.

```bash
{% include dig/process_mbox.sh %}
```

I ended up using Thunderbird with the [ImportExportTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/) extension, which had no trouble importing all of the emails and then exporting them as normal files.
1. Local Folders (right click) > ImportExportTools > Import mbox file.
2. Local Folders (right click) > ImportExportTools > Export all messages in the folder > HTML format (with attachments).

After exporting the emails in this format, I could easily grab all of the attachments with `bash`:

```bash
{% include dig/get_attachments.sh %}
```

## Photos
Processing the already digital photos proved more challenging that I initially expected; many images were present multiple times and in varying resolutions from historical backups of different machines.
I first ran `fdupes` to eliminate any perfect duplicates, which got rid of quite a few files.
Unfortunately, this still left the files at different resolutions.
`findimagedupes` didn't get rid of every duplicate, so I instead turned to `exiftool`.
Rather than finding duplicates directly, I used `exiftool` to organize every photo by date taken, which meant that downsized images would conflict.
I ended up doing far more manual work here than for other content to clean up the files.
This was on top of getting rid of unwanted photos that were not duplicated.

```bash
{% include dig/organize_photos.sh %}
```
