title: Installing MAGMA on Ubuntu 18.04
excerpt: A brief walkthrough of getting the GPU-accelerated linear algebra library MAGMA set up.
---

[MAGMA](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html) is an awesome library providing GPU accelerated versions of BLAS and LAPACK functions.
I've had to install MAGMA a number of times at this point, yet always manage to mess it up on my first try.

## Install CUDA
Follow the directions at <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1804&target_type=debnetwork> to install the latest version of CUDA (e.g. Network Install of 10.1.168-1):
```bash
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1804_10.1.168-1_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1804_10.1.168-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
```

Edit your `~/.bash_aliases` file according to <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#environment-setup>:
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin:/usr/local/cuda-10.1/NsightCompute-2019.1${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64\
                       ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

## Other Prereqs
MAGMA needs a BLAS library as well as a Fortran compiler.
OpenBLAS seems to be the fastest based on a quick search of online benchmarks.
```bash
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev gfortran
```

## Install MAGMA

First, download and extract the latest version (e.g. 2.5.1-alpha1) of the source code from <https://icl.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html>:
```bash
wget http://icl.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/downloads/magma-2.5.1-alpha1.tar.gz
tar -xzf magma-2.5.1-alpha1.tar.gz
```

Update your `~/.bash_aliases` according to <https://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/doxygen/installing.html>:
```bash
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda
export OPENBLASDIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas
```

Build MAGMA and install it.
*This assumes you want to build the default shared library. See <https://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/doxygen/installing.html> and the included README's for detailed instructions.*
The default install directory `/usr/local/magma` will need temporary write permissions for `make install` to succeed:
```bash
make
sudo mkdir /usr/local/magma
sudo chown $(whoami) /usr/local/magma
make install
sudo chown -R root /usr/local/magma
```

Finally, add MAGMA to your shared library path by appending to `~/.bash_aliases`:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/magma/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```
